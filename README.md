- Almost a quarter of the current employees are about to retire.
- 50% of the employees about to retire are directly involved with engineering
- 2 out of 9 managers are retiring. A 22% loss of managerial staff should be a concern. Investing in internal training and/or recruiting external candidates for the managerial position will be necessary.
